---

## Step-by-Step Enrollment Walkthrough

### STEP 1: Choose Your Account Type (DECISION TIME!)

You have two options. Let's figure out which is best for you:

#### Option A: Individual Account
**Best for:** Quick MVP testing, personal projects
**Timeline:** 1-3 days
**Seller Name:** Your personal legal name
**Cost:** $99/year
**Requirements:**
- Valid Apple ID
- Government-issued photo ID
- Credit/debit card

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fast approval (24-48 hours typically)
- ✅ Minimal documentation
- ✅ Can deploy to TestFlight immediately
- ✅ Perfect for testing concept

**Cons:**
- ❌ Shows your personal name as seller/developer
- ❌ Less professional for public launch
- ❌ Harder to transfer app later

#### Option B: Organization Account
**Best for:** Non-profit organizations, professional branding
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks
**Seller Name:** "FamilyUp" or your organization name
**Cost:** $99/year
**Requirements:**
- Legal entity (LLC, Corporation, 501(c)(3))
- D-U-N-S Number (free, takes 1-5 days)
- Business email (@familyup.org)
- Legal authority to bind organization
- Business website with domain

**Pros:**
- ✅ Professional branding ("FamilyUp" as developer)
- ✅ Better for fundraising/grants
- ✅ Team collaboration features
- ✅ Credibility for foster care mission

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slower approval (2-4 weeks)
- ❌ Requires legal entity setup
- ❌ More documentation needed

---

### MY RECOMMENDATION FOR FAMILYUP:

**START WITH INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT** 🚀

**Why?**
1. Get to TestFlight in 2-3 days (not 4 weeks)
2. Validate concept with beta testers first
3. Prove demand before investing in legal entity
4. Can migrate to Organization later if successful

**Strategy:**
- **Week 1:** Enroll as Individual → Fast approval
- **Week 2:** TestFlight beta with foster parents/advocates
- **Weeks 3-4:** Gather feedback, prove concept
- **Month 2:** If successful → Establish 501(c)(3) non-profit
- **Month 3:** Migrate to Organization account
- **Month 4:** Professional App Store launch

**Does this strategy make sense for you?**
