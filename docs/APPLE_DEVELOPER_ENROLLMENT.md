## Decision Matrix: Account Type

### Individual vs Organization Account

| Factor | Individual Account | Organization Account |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Cost** | $99/year | $99/year |
| **Processing Time** | 1-2 days | 2-4 weeks (includes D-U-N-S) |
| **Legal Entity** | Your personal name | Organization name |
| **App Store Display** | Shows your personal name | Shows organization name |
| **Team Size** | Just you (initially) | Multiple team members |
| **D-U-N-S Required** | No | Yes |
| **Legal Documentation** | Government ID only | Business documents required |
| **Best For** | Solo developers, MVPs | Companies, non-profits, teams |

### Recommendation for FamilyUp

**Choose Organization Account IF:**
- You have a registered non-profit (501(c)(3))
- You want "FamilyUp" or your organization name in the App Store
- You plan to build a team
- You want to transfer ownership later
- You're seeking grants that require organizational identity

**Choose Individual Account IF:**
- You want to launch FAST (today/tomorrow)
- You're testing the concept first
- You don't have legal entity paperwork ready
- You can rebrand later if needed

**Quick Start Strategy:** Start with Individual for rapid TestFlight deployment, then migrate to Organization account later if needed.

   - Business type
   - Contact information
   - Number of employees

3. **Wait for Processing**

### D-U-N-S Number Timeline

| Apple's Tool (Existing) | Instant lookup | Free |
