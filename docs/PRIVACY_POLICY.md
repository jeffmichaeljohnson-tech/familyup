# Privacy Policy for FamilyUp

**Last Updated: November 17, 2025**

## Introduction

FamilyUp ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our mobile application and web platform (collectively, the "App"), which provides public awareness about foster care statistics in Michigan.

**Key Point: We do not collect, store, or process any personal information from our users.**

## Information We Do Not Collect

FamilyUp is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do **NOT** collect:

- Personal identification information (names, email addresses, phone numbers)
- Device identifiers or advertising IDs
- Location data or GPS coordinates
- User account information (we do not require user accounts)
- Browsing history or usage analytics
- Cookies or tracking technologies
- Photos, contacts, or any other personal data from your device
- In-app purchases or payment information
- Any information that could identify individual users

## Information We Display

FamilyUp displays publicly available, aggregate statistical information about the Michigan foster care system, including:

- County-level statistics about children in foster care
- General demographic information (age ranges, gender distributions)
- System-wide trends and metrics
- Geographic visualizations of data

**Important:** All displayed data is:
- Aggregated and anonymized at the county or state level
- Derived from publicly available government sources
- Statistical in nature (no individual case information)
- Presented for educational and awareness purposes only

This data cannot be used to identify any individual child, family, or case in the foster care system.

## Third-Party Services

### Mapbox

FamilyUp uses Mapbox to display interactive maps showing Michigan counties and foster care statistics. When you use the map features:

- Mapbox may collect technical information such as IP addresses, device information, and map interaction data
- Mapbox's data collection is governed by their own privacy policy
- You can review Mapbox's Privacy Policy at: https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy

We do not have access to or control over any data that Mapbox may collect. We have configured our Mapbox integration to minimize data collection to only what is necessary for map functionality.

### No Other Third-Party Tracking

We do not use:
- Analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics)
- Advertising networks
- Social media plugins or integrations
- Crash reporting tools that collect personal information
- Any other third-party services that collect user data

## Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)

FamilyUp is safe for users of all ages, including children under 13 years of age.

### Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and protecting the privacy of children:

- **No Personal Information Collection:** We do not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13
- **No Registration Required:** The App does not require users to create accounts or provide any information
- **No Targeted Content:** We do not target advertising or personalized content to children or any users
- **No Social Features:** The App does not include chat, forums, or other communication features
- **Educational Content Only:** The App provides educational information about foster care statistics

### Parental Controls

Because we do not collect any information from children (or adults), there is no personal information for parents to review, modify, or delete. Parents can freely allow children to use FamilyUp without privacy concerns.

### Third-Party Services and Children

While Mapbox (our mapping provider) may collect some technical information, we have configured our integration to minimize data collection. Parents should review Mapbox's privacy policy for more information about their practices.

## Data Security

Even though we do not collect personal information, we maintain strong security practices:

- All data displayed in the App is stored securely
- We use industry-standard security measures to protect our systems
- Our source code and infrastructure are regularly reviewed for security vulnerabilities
- Access to our systems is restricted and monitored

## Data Retention

Since we do not collect personal information from users, there is no personal data to retain or delete. The public statistical data we display is maintained for educational purposes and is updated periodically from official government sources.

## Your Rights and Choices

### Right to Information

You have the right to understand what information is collected about you. As stated throughout this policy, we do not collect any personal information.

### Right to Access and Deletion

Because we do not collect personal information, there is no personal data to access or delete from our systems.

### Opt-Out of Third-Party Data Collection

If you wish to prevent Mapbox from collecting technical information when you use our App:
- You may choose not to interact with the map features
- You can review Mapbox's privacy policy for their opt-out options
- You may use network-level tools to block third-party requests

### Device Permissions

FamilyUp does not request any device permissions (camera, location, contacts, etc.). If you are prompted for permissions, it may be from the Mapbox mapping library for optional map features. You can deny these permissions without affecting the core functionality of the App.

## Updates to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect:
- Changes in our practices
- Legal or regulatory requirements
- User feedback
- Platform requirements

When we make changes:
- We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy

- Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
